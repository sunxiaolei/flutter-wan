  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/avatar.png
    - images/ic_dark.png
    - images/ic_update.png
    - images/ic_theme.png
    - images/ic_favorite.png
    - images/ic_todo.png
    - images/ic_about.png
    - images/ic_launcher.png
    - images/img_card_def.png
    - images/ic_error.png
    - images/ic_empty.png
    - images/ic_todo_empty.png

    - images/card_w.jpg
    - images/card_s.jpg
    - images/card_l.jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
